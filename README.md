# Compiler Optimizing via Deep Reinforcement Learning (COREL)


## Overview

This work aims to employee Deep Reinforcement Learning to solve Compiler Optimizing. 

## Currently Implemented

- AlphaCompile with MCTS

## Roadmap (To be implemented in order)

- PPO for Compiler Optmization
- Genetic Compiler

### Setup

To run this model clone the repo, create a new virtualenv, install requirements from requirements.txt, enjoy!

### Running a model

Run any model as follows: `python -m source.<ModelToRun>`

### Visualizing the Results

This project currently uses MLFlow, to startup the dashboard, call `mlflow ui`.

### Generating Documentation

Documentation for the entire package can be generated by executing `make` from withing the `docs/` directory. To view the resulting docs locally, simply open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Release Notes

### Version 1.0

- Switched from Keras to PyTorch
- Discarded all non-RL models
- Implemented AlphaCompile, based on AlphaZero architecture.
